JOKE: There are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors.

It's really easy to have off-by-1 errors in these problems.
Pay very close attention to your list indexes and your < vs <= operators.

    Assume that xs is a list of numbers sorted from HIGHEST to LOWEST,

    Calculate the number of times that x occurs in xs.

    HINT:
    Use the following three step procedure:
        1) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value >= x
        2) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value < x
        3) return the difference between step 1 and 2
    I highly recommend creating stand-alone functions for steps 1 and 2,
    and write your own doctests for these functions.
    Then, once you're sure these functions work independently,
    completing step 3 will be easy.

def argmin(f, lo, hi, epsilon=1e-3):
    '''
    Assumes that f is an input function that takes a float as input and returns a float with a unique global minimum,
    and that lo and hi are both floats satisfying lo < hi.
    Returns a number that is within epsilon of the value that minimizes f(x) over the interval [lo,hi]

    HINT:
    The basic algorithm is:
        1) The base case is when hi-lo < epsilon
        2) For each recursive call:
            a) select two points m1 and m2 that are between lo and hi
            b) one of the 4 points (lo,m1,m2,hi) must be the smallest;
               depending on which one is the smallest,
               you recursively call your function on the interval [lo,m2] or [m1,hi]

    APPLICATION:
    Essentially all data mining algorithms are just this argmin implementation in disguise.
    If you go on to take the data mining class (CS145/MATH166),
    we will spend a lot of time talking about different f functions that can be minimized and their applications.
    But the actual minimization code will all be a variant of this binary search.

    WARNING:
    The doctests below are not intended to pass on your code,
    and are only given so that you have an example of what the output should look like.
    Your output numbers are likely to be slightly different due to minor implementation details.
    Writing tests for code that uses floating point numbers is notoriously difficult.
    See the pytests for correct examples.
